1) consider implementing one API func that handles getAll, getOne, getTopTen..etc 
    for both the beans and the roasters, and maybe one delete API for them + the review.
    maybe doing this after discovering how the populate works.

2) the getTopTen API logic that was changed completely on 2024年6月25日 has one problem, 
    which is that it doesn't populate the roaster doc of the beans.
    maybe I have no choise but populating it inside the pre(find) hook in the beanModel
